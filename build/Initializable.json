Since a proxied contract can't have a constructor, it's common to move constructor logic to an external initializer function, usually called `initialize`. It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect.  TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as possible by providing the encoded function call as the `_data` argument to {UpgradeableProxy-constructor}.  CAUTION: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke a parent initializer twice, or to ensure that all initializers are idempotent. This is not verified automatically as constructors are by Solidity.\",\"methods\":{},\"stateVariables\":{\"_initialized\":{\"details\":\"Indicates that the contract has been initialized.\"},\"_initializing\":{\"details\":\"Indicates that the contract is in the process of being initialized.\"}}},\"userdoc\":{\"methods\":{}}},\"settings\":{\"compilationTarget\":{\"contracts/proxy/Initializable.sol\":\"Initializable\"},\"evmVersion\":\"istanbul\",\"libraries\":{},\"metadata\":{\"bytecodeHash\":\"ipfs\"},\"optimizer\":{\"enabled\":true,\"runs\":999999},\"remappings\":[]},\"sources\":{\"contracts/proxy/Initializable.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0xe3452700a09c576e6b3bade984c6271357a00279cf849f3cbc03d4561de0de9d\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://0fafe61a781418b8614edb1590b6c06f4a4e19f5f1f4a156c9c7df832ced6699\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmbZNe2tnH7n8s7xUSYBtfLYj4XuECdVH5rtFMh4uik9Jj\"]}},\"version\":1}",
